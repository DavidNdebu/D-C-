  <h1>Our Blog</h1>
  <div class="blog-col">
    <h2>We are so happy to have you in the Studio with us!<h2>
      <p>Some people are seasoned at being photographed. For others it is their first experience. Find out what you need to know before the shoot.<br>
       So, what makes a good headshot and how should prepare for one? Aside from what we covered in part 1 – a good headshot reflects you and your brand.<br>
       You’re selling your wonderful face, but your personality should also shine through with a photo that pops! </p>
    <h2>What kind of headshot do you want?</h2>
    <p>
      Outdoors? In the studio? Three-quarter body shoot? White background? Dark background? <br>
      It’s always a great idea to bring some examples with you to show the photographer. <br>
      It will help them understand exactly what you want. Or, what you don’t want. <br>
      If you had a previous headshot you were unhappy with bring that too. Remember a photo <br>
      is worth a thousand words to explain what you do and don’t want. 
    </p>
    <h2>What to wear</h2>
    <p>What you wear matters but its everything has its beaty. Keep it simple and we'll make it <br>
    extra ordinary for you</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a neckline that is flattering for you. No one can go wrong with a V-neck shape. </li>
      <li>Choose solid or jewel tone colors. Maybe something that brings out your eyes.</li>
      <li>Whites and patterns are a no-no. White is often much to contrasty under the studio lights,<br>
         and we don’t want anything to take away from your face.</li>
      <li>Keep your jewelry simple – no necklaces or heavy earrings.</li>
      <li>Make sure your clothing is clean, wrinkle-free and lint-free.</li>
      <li>Bring a few changes, so you and the photographer can discuss them. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Make-up and hair </h2>
    <p>If you feel comfortable doing your own make-up, practice it the week before. You want to go for <br>
      a natural/glamorous look.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay away from ultra shimmery shadow, glitter, and sparkly makeup. </li>
        <li>Dark lipstick only looks good on a few people – stick with more natural/neutral tones and a <br>
          gloss to accentuate. </li>
        <li>For men, try a translucent powder if you tend to shine. </li>
        <li>Don’t worry about pimples or if your teeth aren’t perfectly white. We can fix that in <br>
          post-production with airbrushing. </li>
      </ul>
